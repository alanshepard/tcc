\section{Requirements}
The controller must
\begin{itemize}
    \item be able to start the engine.
          In case of a failed attempt at starting, it must recover and try again;
    \item prevent surge during all operation;
    \item accelerate and decelerate the engine according to pilot input in a timely fashion;
    \item shutdown the engine safely when the pilot commands it;
    \item detect self extinction and cut-off the fuel supply.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
The controller is implemented as a state machine \cite{amd_state_machine} 
 as shown in \autoref{fig:controller_state_machine}. 
The allowed states are
\begin{description}
    \item[Shutdown] engine is off. 
    \item[Dry cranck] starter motor is on and engine rotates,
          but no fuel is supplied.
    \item[Lights off] the ignition per say. 
    \item[Acceleration and heat soak] after a successful ignition,
          the engine goes through an acceleration schedule that allows heat soaking. 
    \item[Normal Operation] when the engine is warm enough, it can be operated normally.
          This is the flight ready condition.
    \item[Purge] after an unsuccessful start, the engine must eliminate the unburnt fuel. 
    \item[Ground idle] before shutting down, the engine must be in a stable low rpm idle condition.
\end{description}
