Flow stability criteria are presented in terms of net modal damping, as the combination of piping acoustic damping and equivalent negative damping of the compressor in the surge region of its performance curve. Surge and instability frequencies are related to acoustic reactance of the piping system. Finally, theoretical concepts are verified both by electrical analog models and by field and laboratory data on real compressors.

This paper provides some new and significant findings on the dynamic interaction of centrifugal compressors with piping systems, and describes the basic phenomena underlying these interactions. Good agreement is shown between predicted and measured surge frequencies, and for those termed “piping resonance surge” produced by high flow offsets or flat spots in the head curve.},

By incorporating both implicit and explicit equation solvers, transient simulations of the gas turbine engine can be conducted efficiently while maintaining the capability of simulating dynamic events such as compressor stall. ATEC can also be used to address dynamic events or steady-state processes to model both on- and off-design engine operation.},

In this paper, micro-turbojet JetCAT-P80, a aviation gas turbine, was took as the research object, which the thermodynamic parameters of the various sections and the engine performance parameters of the design conditions were solved with the Matlab software. On this basis, GasTurb, a system-level modeling and simulation platform for gas turbine, was introduced. During a certain simplification of the premise, the simulation model on computer for Jet CAT-P80 aviation gas turbine was established, and the steady performance of the off-design conditions was studied, also the impact of external environment on gas turbine relevant performance parameters was detailed analyzed. The results show that the simulation results accurately reflect the steady state performance of gas turbine, and the error between the simulation result and the gas turbine actual operating parameters was within reasonable limits which verify the correctness and rationality of the model established in this paper.},

discharge, but otherwise identical design, has been investigated at tip
speeds of 300 m/s. A laser velocimeter was applied for a detailed flow
analysis, in addition to conventional flow probing and instantaneous
wall pressure recordings. While the inducer flow patterns develop
similarly up to a 3D flow separation at the shroud, significant
differences arise in the second half of the flow channels. Enhanced
jet/wake mixing in the backward-curved region provides a less distorted
exit flow. The impeller flow evaluation is completed by a comparative
discussion of the secondary flow fields and the distinct loss and slip
distributions.

  abstract  = {The paper describes the performance map computation for a centrifugal compressor with a vane-island diffuser. It is shown that the clearance losses between the vane and the shroud are computed well by considering the gap as a diaphragm with a contraction coefficient of one. Performance maps are calculated for two different compressors and compared with measured performance maps. It is found that the agreement is satisfactory except for the surge-line. Finally, it is shown that the theoretical limit determined by boundary layer separation in the entry range of the vane-island diffuser is identical with the measured surge limit for only one of the two compressors.},
