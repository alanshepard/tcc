        It is possible to model a gas turbine engine's static and dynamic behaviour in a realistic way from simple unidimensional flow considerations

        This results in nonlinear models which must be solved numerically. These nonlinear systems can exhibit convergence issues in the lack of appropriate initial guesses when using newton-type solvers. Homotopic/path following solvers may be an alternative.



        \section{Future Work}
        Implement the remaining loss models. Validate the model against experimental data.
