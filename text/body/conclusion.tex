        The Road goes ever on and on     \\
        Down from the door where it began.\\
        Now far ahead the Road has gone,\\
        And I must follow, if I can,\\
        Pursuing it with eager feet,\\
        Until it joins some larger way,\\
        Where many paths and errands meet.\\
        And whither then? I cannot say.

        It is possible to model a gas turbine engine's static and dynamic behavior in a realistic way from simple unidimensional flow considerations

        This results in nonlinear models which must be solved numerically. These nonlinear systems can exhibit convergence issues in the lack of appropriate initial guesses when using newton-type solvers. Homotopic/path following solvers may be an alternative.



        \section{Future Work}
        Implement the remaining loss models. Validate the model against experimental data. Run more dynamical simulations. Improve surge line. Design and test the engine controller.
