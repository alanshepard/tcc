Aerospace Engineering.

## Compile report
To compile the LaTeX report just run `latexmk tcc.tex`

## Compile presentation (in Portuguese)
run `latexmk presentation.tex`

## Source code
The source code used to produce the results is inside the directory `src`. 
It is very poorly documented. 
Mostly there are scripts to generate figures and the underlying classes for simulation.
I suggest you begin reading the code by the file `working_line.py`, which generates the most comprehensive figure.

If you have problems reading or running the code, do not try too hard, it is probably my fault. 
Instead, create an issue [here](https://github.com/alanshepard/tcc/issues/new) explaining the problem  and I will try and have a look at it.
